# Enterprise Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project was developed as part of my Computer Engineering Technology program at Seneca Polytechnic. It focused on designing and configuring a **multi-site enterprise network** in Cisco Packet Tracer with an emphasis on scalability, segmentation, and security.

## Project Overview
The network topology was designed to simulate a corporate IT environment and included:  
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Dividing departments for better traffic management and security  
- **IP Subnetting:** Efficient allocation of address space across multiple sites  
- **Routing:** Static and dynamic routing for inter-VLAN and inter-site communication  
- **DHCP & DNS:** Centralized services for automated IP assignment and domain resolution  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restricting unauthorized traffic while maintaining required access  

## What I Did
- Built and configured the enterprise topology using routers, switches, and end devices.  
- Implemented VLANs and trunk ports to segment departmental traffic.  
- Configured DHCP and DNS to ensure reliable client communication.  
- Set up static and dynamic routing protocols for inter-network connectivity.  
- Applied ACLs to enforce network security and validate traffic restrictions.  
- Tested connectivity and performance using ping, traceroute, and simulated data flows.  

## What I Learned
This project strengthened my knowledge of:  
- Enterprise-level network design and topology planning  
- VLANs, subnetting, and IP addressing strategies  
- DHCP and DNS configuration in a multi-site environment  
- Routing protocols and troubleshooting techniques  
- Security enforcement using ACLs in Cisco environments
